# Churn bros: attrited customers - can we cluster?
#### A machine learning exploration project written in Python 3.11, by George Hollingdale

nb: this is an incomplete learning project, findings are not concluded nor concrete.

The purpose of this repository is to help ficticious bank Churn Bros. ltd. identify customer groups that are attriting. They would like to use these groups to inform their marketing department to target these client groups to try and retain them. The data is also ficticious and required a little cleaning. 

# Requirements
Requirements can be found in [requirements.txt]('/requirements.txt/')
It is recommended that you install the requirements in a fresh virtual environment using the command
> pip install -r requirements.txt

# Outcome
After combining attributes into a single dimension, I found the optimum number of clusters would be 5. I was unable to label these clusters speficically, but you can my tableau charts that will give you an idea of what the clustering could look like as a mvp.

# Timeline
The timeline for this learning project was half a week.
